# CS-340 Module Eight Journal

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs requires clear documentation, modular code design, and adherence to best practices like using meaningful variable names and consistent formatting. In Project One, I implemented a CRUD Python module with well-structured functions, ensuring that future modifications would be easy. The advantage of this approach was that it allowed seamless integration with the dashboard in Project Two. This module can be reused in future applications where similar database interactions are needed.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems methodically by analyzing requirements, breaking them into smaller tasks, and applying structured problem-solving techniques. For Project Two, I considered how the database queries would interact with the dashboard to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience. Unlike previous assignments, this project required real-world considerations, such as user authentication and data security. Going forward, I will continue refining my approach by optimizing queries and improving UI/UX to better serve client needs.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop software solutions that enhance efficiency, automate tasks, and solve complex problems for businesses and individuals. My work on this project demonstrates how integrating a CRUD system with a dashboard can help a company like Grazioso Salvare manage its animal shelter data more effectively. This type of project highlights the importance of database management and data visualization in making informed decisions.
